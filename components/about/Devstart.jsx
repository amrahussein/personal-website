      <Heading>How has my DEV started?</Heading>

      <p>
        My journey started with a scholarship by Udacity that taught me the
        basics of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was introduced to computational thinking; that&apos;s how to think
        like the computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to, the difference between procedural and descriptive
        programming. Also, the importance of abstract thinking that has to do
        with descriptive programming
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary motivation, besides my passion for tech, was the influence of
        digital transformation I saw. The influence that can be brought by the
        tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a dream for me to have positive influence on the world or simply
        to produce a useful product with a few lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        By that time I decided to have core knowledge about computer science
        before having to specialize.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I decided to have a different approach, which was to specialize
        in a specific area: frontend development along with learning core
        science and exploring new stuff as I love to solve problems.
