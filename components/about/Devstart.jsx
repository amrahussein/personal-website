      <p>
        Started my programming journey with Python &amp; Java: Python introduced
        me to programming theory for solving real-life problems whereas Java
        introduced me to fundamentals of OOP principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        This gives me the opportunity to be language-agnostic exploring computer
        sci principles behind a programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey with Python started with a scholarship by Udacity that taught
        me the core principles of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was introduced to core concepts like computational thinking,
        procedural and descriptive programming. In addition to the importance of
        abstract thinking that has to do with descriptive programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a dream for me to have a positive influence on the world or
        simply to produce a useful product with a few lines of code by
        understanding how Technology works.
      </p>
      <p>
        By that time I decided to have core knowledge about computer science
        before having to specialize.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I decided to have a different approach, which was to{' '}
        <em>specialize</em> in a specific area:{' '}
        <strong>frontend development</strong> along with learning core science
        and exploring new stuff as <em>I love to solve problems.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve also expanded my <strong>backend knowledge</strong>. As an ITI
        graduate, I gained much professional experience in{' '}
        <strong>backend development</strong> with real-world projects.
