        Let&apos;s sum it up by my core values. As I grow up in the field, I can
        see the importance of{' '}
        <em className='text-secondary underline'>valuing feedback</em> from
        different people.

        I believe each of us is a <em>mentor and a mentee</em> alongside each

        <em className='text-secondary underline'>give values</em> as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em className='text-secondary underline'>Integrity</em> is another
        aspect of my core values.{' '}
        <em className='text-secondary underline'>
          Transparency and open-mindedness

        are beneficial factors to any community.

        an impact on my personality is to <em>communicate well</em>. As{' '}
        <em className='text-secondary underline'>Clean code and simplicity</em>{' '}
        improves on communication among project partners and can, surly, scale
        any project effectively.
