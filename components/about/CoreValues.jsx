        Let&apos;s sum it up by my core values. As I grow up in the field, I can
        see the importance of{' '}
        <em className='underline text-secondary'>valuing feedback</em> from
        different people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe each of us is a <em>mentor and a mentee</em> alongside each
        other. Wouldn&apos;t it be great to be a mentee to more knowledgeable
        people? Of course, it&apos;s rewarding to{' '}
        <em className='underline text-secondary'>give values</em> as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em className='underline text-secondary'>Integrity</em> is another
        aspect of my core values.{' '}
        <em className='underline text-secondary'>
          Transparency and open-mindedness
        </em>{' '}
        are beneficial factors to any community.

        impact on my personality is to <em>communicate well</em>{' '}
        <em className='underline text-secondary'>Clean code and simplicity</em>{' '}
        can, surely, scale any project pretty well.
