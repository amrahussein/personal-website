        Looking back into my old days, I was curious about learning languages,
        knowing people online, playing games esp soccer games. I remember PES 6
        was the first one that got me addicted. Now, FIFA is my king!

        Technology, for sure, has been a great part of my life since my
        childhood. <aside>I remember my first email was around 2007, and my first FB
        was around 2009 fb.com/amr.tiger.96780 before my main one
        fb.com/amromoorie/ and it&apos;s a great idea to get connected!</aside>

        One of the things about myself, that came obvious to me early on, was
        that I liked to explore the world, in addition to, learning from
        different people.

        The internet, to me, was a chance to learn a lot about the world. I was
        not sure about my exact dream job, but I had an idea of what direction
        could suit my personality. A type of direction that involves languages,
        science, research, or Technology.

        What I came to realize was that everyone had a different learning style
        with a different mindset that affects the way one sees the world. I
        think the world of DEV embraces that where I want to grow and
        contribute.
