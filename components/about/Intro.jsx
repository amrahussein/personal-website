          I&apos;ve been grateful to have a <em className='text-secondary'>multidisciplinary education:</em> English
          Literature and Linguistics along with a wide range of topics. This
          opened my eyes to different perspectives and inspirations with the
          flexibility that allowed me to adapt to various contexts.

          It has been helpful to me as the world is becoming increasingly
          complex and uncertain in a set of circumstances. It gave me a great
          opportunity to get to know myself, as well as, the surrounding world.

          In my graduation project, my primary research focused on Linguistic
          aspects of one work of Art. It&apos;s great to get to know how people
          use language in context!{' '}
