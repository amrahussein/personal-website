  <p className="">I&apos;ve been grateful to have a multidisciplinary education: English Literature and Linguistics along with a wide range of topics.
       This opened my eyes to different perspectives and inspirations with the flexibility that allowed me to adapt to various contexts.</p>
       <p>
       It has been helpful to me as the world is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain in a set of circumstances. It gave me a great opportunity to get to know myself, as well as, the surrounding world.
       </p>
       <p> In my graduation project, my primary research focused on Linguistic aspects of one work of Art. It&apos;s great to get to know how people use language in context! </p>
