      <h2>After graduation</h2>
      <p>Fast forward after graduation, I began to be more aware of what direction I should be going, I had to know myself deeper. That&apos;s why, I seek Coursera courses in various non-tech areas, besides any activity that would introduce me to the community and people.</p>
      <p>I joined the GCP scholarship by google which partnered with Pluralsight, I had a great introduction to the cloud as well as a great involvement with the community. I learned a lot and gained a lot of perspectives.</p>
      <p> The non-tech courses were no less great for me to make a connection between tech and people.</p>
      <p> I, then, followed volunteering activities to apply what I have learned. 
What I can say is that willing to get to know different peoples&apos; thoughts increase the chance of mutual matching of common goal and value. It&apos;s absolutely an integral part of any project&apos;s success.</p>
