      <p>
        Fast forward after graduation, I began to be more aware of what
        direction I should be going, I had to know myself deeper. That&apos;s
        why, I attended Coursera courses in various non-tech areas, besides any
        activity that would introduce me to the community and the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined <em className='text-secondary'>GCP scholarship</em> by google
        partnered with Pluralsight, I had a great introduction to the cloud as
        well as a great involvement with the community. I learned a lot and
        gained a lot of perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        The non-tech courses were no less great for me to make a connection
        between tech and people.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        I, then, followed{' '}
        <em className='underline text-secondary'>volunteering activities</em> to
        apply what I have learned. What I can say is that willing to get to know
        different peoples&apos; thoughts increase the chance of mutual matching
        of common goal and value. I see it as an integral part of any
        project&apos;s success.
