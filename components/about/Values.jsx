      <h2>My core values?</h2>
      <p>Let&apos;s sum it up by my core values. As I grow up in the field, I can see the importance of valuing feedback from different people.</p>
      <p>I believe each of us is a mentor and a mentee alongside each other. Wouldn&apos;t it be great to be a mentee to more knowledgeable people? Of course, it&apos;s rewarding to give values as well.</p>
        <p>Integrity is another aspect of my core values. Transparency and open-mindedness are beneficial factors to any community.</p>
        <p>One of the values, I learned back in my University days, that has an impact on my personality is to communicate well. Clean code and simplicity can, surely, scale any project pretty well.</p>
