      <h2>What about my tech stack specialization?</h2>
      <p> I, deeply, focus on JavaScript with Frontend Libraries and Frameworks such as React, NextJS.</p>
      <h2>What am I currently into?</h2>
      <p>Building a usable website that addresses user needs (UX) lies at my core.</p>
      <p>As the digital platforms expand, it&apos;s not practical to have various sources of truth; that&apos;s the user data. Using flux-like architecture in React apps comes to the rescue and addresses business needs.</p>
      <p>Although I know basic redux, I need to implement what I have learned into big projects.</p>
      <p>In addition, I&apos;d like to dig deeper into micro-frameworks like ExpressJS, FastAPI, and Flask that can help me manage APIs. It gives me the flexibility to address the philosophy of the modern web.</p>
