This opened my eyes to different perspectives and inspirations with the flexibility that allowed me to adapt to various contexts.</p><p>It has been helpful to me as the world is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain in a set of circumstances. It gave me a great opportunity to get to know myself, as well as, the surrounding world.</p><p> In my graduation project, my primary research focused on Linguistic aspects of one work of Art. It&#x27;s great to get to know how people use language in context! </p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 text-3xl"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>In my old days...</h2><p>Looking back into my old days, I was curious about learning languages, knowing people online, playing games esp soccer games. I remember PES 6 was the first one that got me addicted. Now, FIFA is my king!</p><p>Technology, for sure, has been a great part of my life since my childhood. <aside>I remember my first email was around 2007, and my first FB was around 2009 <span class="hover:underline "><a href="https://fb.com/amr.tiger.96780">fb.com/amr.tiger.96780</a></span> before my main one<span class="hover:underline "><a href="https://fb.com/amromoorie/"> fb.com/amromoorie/</a></span> and it&#x27;s a great idea to get connected!</aside></p><p>One of the things about myself, that came obvious to me early on, was that I liked to explore the world, in addition to, learning from different people.</p><p>The internet, to me, was a chance to learn a lot about the world. I was not sure about my exact dream job, but I had an idea of what direction could suit my personality. A type of direction that involves languages, science, research, or Technology.</p><p>What I came to realize was that everyone had a different learning style with a different mindset that affects the way one sees the world. I think the world of DEV embraces that where I want to grow and contribute.</p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 text-3xl"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>How has my DEV started?</h2><p>My journey started with a scholarship by Udacity that taught me the basics of programming.</p><p>I was introduced to computational thinking; that&#x27;s how to think like the computer.</p><p>In addition to, the difference between procedural and descriptive programming. Also, the importance of abstract thinking that has to do with descriptive programming</p><p>My primary motivation, besides my passion for tech, was the influence of digital transformation I saw. The influence that can be brought by the tech.</p><p>It was a dream for me to have positive influence on the world or simply to produce a useful product with a few lines of code.</p><p>By that time I decided to have core knowledge about computer science before having to specialize.</p><p>However, I decided to have a different approach, which was to specialize in a specific area: frontend development along with learning core science and exploring new stuff as I love to solve problems.</p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 text-3xl"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>After graduation</h2><p>Fast forward after graduation, I began to be more aware of what direction I should be going, I had to know myself deeper. That&#x27;s why, I seek Coursera courses in various non-tech areas, besides any activity that would introduce me to the community and people.</p><p>I joined the GCP scholarship by google which partnered with Pluralsight, I had a great introduction to the cloud as well as a great involvement with the community. I learned a lot and gained a lot of perspectives.</p><p> <!-- -->The non-tech courses were no less great for me to make a connection between tech and people.</p><p> <!-- -->I, then, followed volunteering activities to apply what I have learned. What I can say is that willing to get to know different peoples&#x27; thoughts increase the chance of mutual matching of common goal and value. It&#x27;s absolutely an integral part of any project&#x27;s success.</p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 text-3xl"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>My core values?</h2><p>Let&#x27;s sum it up by my core values. As I grow up in the field, I can see the importance of valuing feedback from different people.</p><p>I believe each of us is a mentor and a mentee alongside each other. Wouldn&#x27;t it be great to be a mentee to more knowledgeable people? Of course, it&#x27;s rewarding to give values as well.</p><p>Integrity is another aspect of my core values. Transparency and open-mindedness are beneficial factors to any community.</p><p>One of the values, I learned back in my University days, that has an impact on my personality is to communicate well. Clean code and simplicity can, surely, scale any project pretty well.</p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 text-3xl"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>What about my tech stack specialization?</h2><p> <!-- -->I, deeply, focus on JavaScript with Frontend Libraries and Frameworks such as React, NextJS.</p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 text-3xl"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>What am I currently into?</h2><p>Building a usable website that addresses user needs (UX) lies at my core.</p><p>As the digital platforms expand, it&#x27;s not practical to have various sources of truth; that&#x27;s the user data. Using flux-like architecture in React apps comes to the rescue and addresses business needs.</p><p>Although I know basic redux, I need to implement what I have learned into big projects.</p><p>In addition, I&#x27;d like to dig deeper into micro-frameworks like ExpressJS, FastAPI, and Flask that can help me manage APIs. It gives me the flexibility to address the philosophy of the modern web.</p><h2 class="pt-5 text-primary opacity-70 hover:opacity-100 lg"><span class="text-important hover:opacity-100"># </span>You can check my latest projects at my</h2><span class="hover:underline "><a href="https://github.com/amromoorie">GitHub account.</a></span><span class="hover:underline block"><a href="https://github.com/amromoorie?tab=repositories">take me to Github repo</a></span></article></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/about","query":{},"buildId":"tMxVy0aQ_Jr1xEmwKSIu7","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
